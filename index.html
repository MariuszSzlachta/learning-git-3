          <p class="song-verse">
            <span>Build a fire and fan the flame</span>
            <span>Sacrifice without a name</span>
            <span>Offerings on the altar to the unknown god</span>
          </p>
          <p class="song-verse">
            <span>Multitudes of gods cover our landscapes and our lives</span>
            <span>Images of deities and halls of sacrifice</span>
            <span>Philosophers and scholars and sophisticates we are</span>
            <span>Our gods are our religion and religion is our god</span>
          </p>
          <p class="song-verse">
            <span>A stranger came to town one day</span>
            <span>And fearlessly proclaimed</span>
            <span>“The unknown god you worship</span>
            <span>On this altar has a name”</span>
            <span>He said, “This god is not an image</span>
            <span>Or a statue of the dead</span>
            <span>In Him we live and have our being</span>
            <span>As your own poets have said”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="song-verse">
            <span>Build a fire and fan the flame</span>
            <span>Sacrifice without a name</span>
            <span>Offerings on the altar to the unknown god</span>
            <span>Dance around the altar blaze</span>
            <span>Brings the works your hands have made</span>
            <span>Place them on the altar to the unknown god</span>
          </p>
          <p class="song-verse">
            <span>He dwells not in temples</span>
            <span>Built by human hands</span>
            <span>He needs no assistance</span>
            <span>Or service of man</span>
            <span>The nameless you worship</span>
            <span>Is greater than all</span>
            <span>Your idols of death</span>
            <span>Never answer your call</span>
            <span>All nations He formed</span>
            <span>From the flesh of one man</span>
            <span>He marked out their times</span>
            <span>And the boundaries of lands</span>
            <span>Your life and your breath</span>
            <span>He bestows with the day</span>
            <span>So seek Him and find Him</span>
            <span>For He is not far away</span>
          </p>
          <p class="song-verse">
            <span>Fire upon the altar</span>
            <span>Burns the sacrifice</span>
            <span>Sacrificial lamb was slain to pay the final price</span>
            <span>Come, ye heavy laden</span>
            <span>Sinner’s mercy cry</span>
            <span>The unknown God your call upon is nigh</span>
          </p>
          <p class="song-verse">
            <span>Gather ‘round the altar</span>
            <span>Stoke the holy fire</span>
            <span>Purifying flames of righteousness</span>
            <span>Are rising higher</span>
            <span>Come ye hungry, eat the bread of life</span>
            <span>And drink the wine</span>
            <span>Altar to the living God divine</span>
          </p>
          <p class="song-verse">
            <span>No image of stone or of silver and gold</span>
            <span>No effigy mankind has raised to behold</span>
            <span>The day and the hour of judgment is set</span>
            <span>He’s proven Him by the resurrection of the dead</span>
          </p>
          <p class="song-verse">
            <span>Build a fire and fan the flame</span>
            <span>Sacrifice without a name</span>
            <span>Offerings on the altar to the unknown god</span>
            <span>Stand before the altar blaze</span>
            <span>Bring the lives His hands have made</span>
            <span>Place them on the altar to the one true god</span>
            <span>Your unknown god</span>
            <span>Is the one living God</span>
