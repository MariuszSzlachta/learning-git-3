      <h2 class="song-title">Altar to the Unknown God</h2>
      <p class="song-verse">Build a fire and fan the flame
          Sacrifice without a name
          Offerings on the altar to the unknown god</p>
      <p class="song-verse">
          Multitudes of gods cover our landscapes and our lives
          Images of deities and halls of sacrifice
          Philosophers and scholars and sophisticates we are
          Our gods are our religion and religion is our god
      </p>
      <p class="song-verse">
          A stranger came to town one day
          And fearlessly proclaimed
          “The unknown god you worship
          On this altar has a name”
          He said, “This god is not an image
          Or a statue of the dead
          In Him we live and have our being
          As your own poets have said”
      </p>
      <p class="song-verse">
        Build a fire and fan the flame
        Sacrifice without a name
        Offerings on the altar to the unknown god
        Dance around the altar blaze
        Brings the works your hands have made
        Place them on the altar to the unknown god
      </p>
      <p class="song-verse">
        He dwells not in temples
        Built by human hands
        He needs no assistance
        Or service of man
        The nameless you worship
        Is greater than all
        Your idols of death
        Never answer your call
        All nations He formed
        From the flesh of one man
        He marked out their times
        And the boundaries of lands
        Your life and your breath
        He bestows with the day
        So seek Him and find Him
        For He is not far away
       </p>
